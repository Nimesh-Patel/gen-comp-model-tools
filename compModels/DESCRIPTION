Description: This package enables users to programmatically build compartmental
             models using descriptive input, as opposed to math. The package
             includes deterministic and stochastic modeling functionality and
             the compiled model object produced can be used to connection a
             variety of other packages and modeling tools. The generalizability
             and modularity of the package tools speeds up both simple and
             complex model development and enables users to easily add/remove/
             stratify/chain compartments and automatically generates states and
             processes.
